The BOPE is the squad of special forces of police that usually handles the operations
in the Favelas in Rio de Janeiro.

In this Kata you have to write a function that determine the number of magazines that every soldier
has to have in his bag.

You will receive the weapon and the number of streets that they have to cross.
Considering that every street the officer shoots 3 times. Bellow there is the relation of weapons:

PT92 - 17 bullets
M4A1 - 30 bullets
M16A2 - 30 bullets
PSG1 - 5 bullets

Example:

["PT92", 6] => 2 (6 streets 3 bullets each)
["M4A1", 6] => 1

The return Will always be an integer so as the params.

NOTE: In C the weapon and number of streets are passed in as two separate arguments
(the first one a string, the second an integer) instead of a single array.

#include <stddef.h>

size_t mag_number(const char *weapon_name, size_t streets) {
  return 0;
}
*/
#include <stddef.h>
#include <string.h>
size_t mag_number(const char *weapon_name, size_t streets) {
if(strcmp(weapon_name,"PT92")==0){
return (streets*3-1)/17+1;
}
else if(strcmp(weapon_name,"M4A1")==0){
return (streets*3-1)/30+1;
}
else if(strcmp(weapon_name,"M16A2")==0){
return (streets*3-1)/30+1;
}
else if(strcmp(weapon_name,"PSG1")==0){
return (streets*3-1)/5+1;
}
return 0;
}
