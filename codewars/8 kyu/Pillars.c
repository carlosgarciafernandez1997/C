There are pillars near the road.
The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same.
Your function accepts three arguments:

number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

  return (num_of_pillars>1)*((num_of_pillars-2)*width+(num_of_pillars-1)*distance*100);
